# Data-structure-and-Algo
# DSA Practice Repository 🚀

This repo is where I’m keeping track of my DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice. Most of the problems here are from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and sometimes custom ones I come across. I'm mainly using C++ unless otherwise needed.

## 🔧 What you’ll find here

- Solutions to a wide range of problems — arrays, strings, trees, DP, graphs, etc.
- Clean and readable code (I try to write code that I can come back to and still understand).
- Gradually improving the structure and adding explanations where it helps.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder or file typically includes:
- The problem name or number.
- A `.cpp` file with my solution (sometimes includes comments or multiple approaches).
- Possibly a `README.md` inside a folder if the problem needs more explanation.

## Why I made this

I'm using this repo as a personal log of my problem-solving journey. It helps me:
- Revisit tough problems later.
- Notice patterns in mistakes or repeated concepts.
- Keep track of how my thinking improves over time.

## 🛠️ In Progress

- Adding more problems weekly.
- Might organize by topic or difficulty level later.
- Adding brute-force vs optimized versions for selected problems.

## 💬 Suggestions?

If you’re randomly here and have ideas for improvements or organization, feel free to open an issue or drop a comment.
